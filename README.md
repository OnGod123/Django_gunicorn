Installation
You can install Gunicorn using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install gunicorn
Basic Usage
1. Create a WSGI Application
First, you need a WSGI application. Here's an example myapp.py:

python
Copy code
# myapp.py

def app(environ, start_response):
    data = b"Hello, World!\n"
    start_response("200 OK", [
        ("Content-Type", "text/plain"),
        ("Content-Length", str(len(data)))
    ])
    return iter([data])
2. Run Gunicorn
Run Gunicorn to serve your application:

bash
Copy code
gunicorn -w 4 myapp:app
-w 4: Specifies the number of worker processes (in this case, 4).
myapp:app: Points to the app callable in the myapp.py module.
3. Binding to an Address and Port
By default, Gunicorn binds to 127.0.0.1:8000. You can change this using the -b flag:

bash
Copy code
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 myapp:app
This will bind the server to all available IP addresses on port 5000.

Advanced Configuration
Using a Configuration File
You can use a configuration file to manage Gunicorn settings. Create a gunicorn_config.py:

python
Copy code
# gunicorn_config.py

bind = "0.0.0.0:5000"
workers = 4
Run Gunicorn with the configuration file:

bash
Copy code
gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py myapp:app
Daemonizing Gunicorn
To run Gunicorn as a background process (daemon):

bash
Copy code
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 myapp:app --daemon
Logging
Gunicorn provides various logging options. For example, to enable access and error logs:

bash
Copy code
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 myapp:app --access-logfile access.log --error-logfile error.log
Integrating with Nginx
For better performance and security, you can use Nginx as a reverse proxy in front of Gunicorn.

Nginx Configuration
Add the following to your Nginx configuration (e.g., /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp):

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
Restart Nginx
Restart Nginx to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Tips
Number of Workers: A common rule of thumb is to use (2 x $num_cores) + 1 workers.
Timeouts: Adjust the timeout settings according to your application needs using the --timeout option.
bash
Copy code
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 myapp:app --timeout 120
